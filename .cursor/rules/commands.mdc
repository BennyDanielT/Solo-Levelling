# Cursor AI Rules

## Development Server

- NEVER run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or any development server commands automatically
- Only run dev server if explicitly requested by the user
- Assume the user will manually start/restart their dev server when needed

## General Commands

- Don't run commands automatically after making code changes
- Only run commands when specifically asked by the user
- Focus on making code changes and explaining what was done

## Testing

- Don't automatically run tests unless explicitly requested
- Don't run build commands unless explicitly requested
